              Spain, country located in extreme southwestern Europe. It occupies
              about 85 percent of the Iberian Peninsula, which it shares with
              its smaller neighbor Portugal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains,
              vast monuments, and sophisticated cities, all of which have made
              it a favoured travel destination. The country is geographically
              and culturally diverse. Its heartland is the Meseta, a broad
              central plateau half a mile above sea level. Much of the region is
              traditionally given over to cattle ranching and grain production;
              it was in this rural setting that Miguel de Cervantes’s Don
              Quixote tilted at the tall windmills that still dot the landscape
              in several places. In the country’s northeast are the broad valley
              of the Ebro River, the mountainous region of Catalonia, and the
              hilly coastal plain of Valencia. To the northwest is the
              Cantabrian Mountains, a rugged range in which heavily forested,
              rain-swept valleys are interspersed with tall peaks. To the south
              is the citrus-orchard-rich and irrigated lands of the valley of
              the Guadalquivir River, celebrated in the renowned lyrics of
              Spanish poets Federico García Lorca and Antonio Machado; over this
              valley rises the snowcapped Sierra Nevada. The southern portion of
              the country is desert, an extension of the Sahara made familiar to
              Americans through the “spaghetti western” films of the 1960s and
              early ’70s. Lined with palm trees, rosemary bushes, and other
              tropical vegetation, the southeastern Mediterranean coast and the
              Balearic Islands enjoy a gentle climate, drawing millions of
              visitors and retirees, especially from northern Europe.

              The famous and beautiful city, Madrid, is the capital of Spain.
              Madrid, the largest city in Spain, is also the capital of a small
              autonomous region and is geographically located in the middle of
              the country and the Spanish plateau. Madrid is the third largest
              city in the European Union after Paris and London.
            </p>
            <p>
              The population of Madrid, including the people around it, was more
              than 6.5 million and the city has an area of 604.3 square
              kilometers. Madrid is the main city on the Iberian Peninsula due
              to its political, sports, economic and geographical backgrounds.

              According to the latest estimates, the current population of Spain
              is about 47 million. The population density in this country is 92
              people per square kilometer. The dispersion of the population in
              Spain is very unequal; With the exception of Madrid and its
              environs, the majority of the country's population lives in the
              coastal areas. It is interesting to know that the population of
              this country in 1900 was close to 18 million people.
            </p>
            <p>
              The highest population growth in Spain dates back to the 60s and
              70s. Immigrants make up about 12 percent of the country's
              population. Also in recent decades, a number of Spanish natives
              who had emigrated from this country have returned to their
              homeland. Spain is the 52nd largest country in the world with an
              area of ​​505,992 square kilometers.
            </p>
            <p>
              For comparison, Spain is about 47,000 square kilometers smaller
              than France and 81,000 square kilometers larger than the US state
              of California. Spain is located between 26 and 44 degrees north,
              as well as the meridians 5 and 19 degrees east.
