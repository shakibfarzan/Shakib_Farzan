    <p>
      Spain, country located in extreme southwestern Europe. It occupies about
      85 percent of the Iberian Peninsula, which it shares with its smaller
      neighbor Portugal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast
      monuments, and sophisticated cities, all of which have made it a favoured
      travel destination. The country is geographically and culturally diverse.
      Its heartland is the Meseta, a broad central plateau half a mile above sea
      level. Much of the region is traditionally given over to cattle ranching
      and grain production; it was in this rural setting that Miguel de
      Cervantes’s Don Quixote tilted at the tall windmills that still dot the
      landscape in several places. In the country’s northeast are the broad
      valley of the Ebro River, the mountainous region of Catalonia, and the
      hilly coastal plain of Valencia. To the northwest is the Cantabrian
      Mountains, a rugged range in which heavily forested, rain-swept valleys
      are interspersed with tall peaks. To the south is the citrus-orchard-rich
      and irrigated lands of the valley of the Guadalquivir River, celebrated in
      the renowned lyrics of Spanish poets Federico García Lorca and Antonio
      Machado; over this valley rises the snowcapped Sierra Nevada. The southern
      portion of the country is desert, an extension of the Sahara made familiar
      to Americans through the “spaghetti western” films of the 1960s and early
      ’70s. Lined with palm trees, rosemary bushes, and other tropical
      vegetation, the southeastern Mediterranean coast and the Balearic Islands
      enjoy a gentle climate, drawing millions of visitors and retirees,
      especially from northern Europe.

      region and is geographically located in the middle of the country and the
      Spanish plateau. Madrid is the third largest city in the European Union
      after Paris and London.
    </p>
    <p>

      6.5 million and the city has an area of 604.3 square kilometers. Madrid is

      According to the latest estimates, the current population of Spain is
      about 47 million. The population density in this country is 92 people per
      square kilometer. The dispersion of the population in Spain is very
      unequal; With the exception of Madrid and its environs, the majority of
      the country's population lives in the coastal areas. It is interesting to
      know that the population of this country in 1900 was close to 18 million
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest population growth in Spain dates back to the 60s and 70s.
      Immigrants make up about 12 percent of the country's population. Also in
      recent decades, a number of Spanish natives who had emigrated from this
      country have returned to their homeland. Spain is the 52nd largest country
      in the world with an area of ​​505,992 square kilometers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For comparison, Spain is about 47,000 square kilometers smaller than
      France and 81,000 square kilometers larger than the US state of
      California. Spain is located between 26 and 44 degrees north, as well as
      the meridians 5 and 19 degrees east.
