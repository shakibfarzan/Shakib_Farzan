            Spain, country located in extreme southwestern Europe. It occupies
            about 85 percent of the Iberian Peninsula, which it shares with its
            smaller neighbor Portugal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains,
            vast monuments, and sophisticated cities, all of which have made it
            a favoured travel destination. The country is geographically and
            culturally diverse. Its heartland is the Meseta, a broad central
            plateau half a mile above sea level. Much of the region is
            traditionally given over to cattle ranching and grain production; it
            was in this rural setting that Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote
            tilted at the tall windmills that still dot the landscape in several
            places. In the country’s northeast are the broad valley of the Ebro
            River, the mountainous region of Catalonia, and the hilly coastal
            plain of Valencia. To the northwest is the Cantabrian Mountains, a
            rugged range in which heavily forested, rain-swept valleys are
            interspersed with tall peaks. To the south is the
            citrus-orchard-rich and irrigated lands of the valley of the
            Guadalquivir River, celebrated in the renowned lyrics of Spanish
            poets Federico García Lorca and Antonio Machado; over this valley
            rises the snowcapped Sierra Nevada. The southern portion of the
            country is desert, an extension of the Sahara made familiar to
            Americans through the “spaghetti western” films of the 1960s and
            early ’70s. Lined with palm trees, rosemary bushes, and other
            tropical vegetation, the southeastern Mediterranean coast and the
            Balearic Islands enjoy a gentle climate, drawing millions of
            visitors and retirees, especially from northern Europe.

            The famous and beautiful city, Madrid, is the capital of Spain.
            Madrid, the largest city in Spain, is also the capital of a small
            autonomous region and is geographically located in the middle of the
            country and the Spanish plateau. Madrid is the third largest city in
            the European Union after Paris and London.
          </p>
          <p>
            The population of Madrid, including the people around it, was more
            than 6.5 million and the city has an area of 604.3 square
            kilometers. Madrid is the main city on the Iberian Peninsula due to
            its political, sports, economic and geographical backgrounds.

            According to the latest estimates, the current population of Spain
            is about 47 million. The population density in this country is 92
            people per square kilometer. The dispersion of the population in
            Spain is very unequal; With the exception of Madrid and its
            environs, the majority of the country's population lives in the
            coastal areas. It is interesting to know that the population of this
            country in 1900 was close to 18 million people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The highest population growth in Spain dates back to the 60s and
            70s. Immigrants make up about 12 percent of the country's
            population. Also in recent decades, a number of Spanish natives who
            had emigrated from this country have returned to their homeland.
            Spain is the 52nd largest country in the world with an area of
            ​​505,992 square kilometers.
          </p>
          <p>
            For comparison, Spain is about 47,000 square kilometers smaller than
            France and 81,000 square kilometers larger than the US state of
            California. Spain is located between 26 and 44 degrees north, as
            well as the meridians 5 and 19 degrees east.
